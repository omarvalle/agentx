TASK: Create the following web project: create website that says Welcome to SF!

IMPORTANT:
1. Please create all necessary files to implement this request
2. You MUST use the fs_write tool to SAVE your implementation in the current directory
3. Do not just show the code - you need to actually write the files to disk
4. You have full permission to write files here - please use the fs_write tool

Example of writing a file:
1. Use the fs_write tool to create index.html
2. Include all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

If the user wants a simple page, create that. If they want a complex app or interactive website, implement that. Don't be limited to simple solutions - use your capabilities to create what best meets the requirements.
