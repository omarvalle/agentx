/compact	Compacts the conversation history and shows the output of the compacted conversation history
Managing tool permissions

You can use the /tools command to manage permissions for tools that Amazon Q uses to perform actions on your system. This provides granular control over what actions Amazon Q can perform.

Tools commands
Command	Description
help	Shows help related to tools.
trust	Trusts a specific tool for the session.
untrust	Reverts a tool to per-request confirmation.
trustall	Trusts all tools (equivalent to deprecated /acceptall).
reset	Resets all tools to default permission levels.
To view the current permission settings for all tools:

$ q chat
Amazon Q> /tools
This displays a list of all available tools and their current permission status (trusted or per-request).

Tool permissions have two possible states:

Trusted: Amazon Q can use the tool without asking for confirmation each time.

Per-request: Amazon Q must ask for your confirmation each time before using the tool.

To trust or untrust a specific tool for the current session:

Amazon Q> /tools trust fs_read
Amazon Q> /tools untrust execute_bash


You can also trust all tools at once with /tools trustall(equivalent to the deprecated /acceptall command):

Amazon Q> /tools trustall
Warning
Using /tools trustall carries risks. For more information, see Understanding security risks.



The following image shows the status of the CLI tools when they are all in their default trust status.



The following tools are natively available for Amazon Q to use:

Available tools
Tool	Description
fs_read	Reads files and directories on your system.
fs_write	Creates and modifies files on your system.
execute_bash	Executes bash commands on your system.
use_aws	Makes AWS CLI calls to interact with AWS services.
report_issue	Opens a browser to report an issue with the chat to AWS.
When Amazon Q attempts to use a tool that doesn't have explicit permission, it will ask for your approval before proceeding. You can choose to allow or deny the action, or trust the tool for the remainder of your session.

Each tool has a default trust behavior. fs_read is the only tool that is trusted by default.

Here are some examples of when to use different permission levels:

Trust fs_read: When you want Amazon Q to read files without confirmation, such as when exploring a codebase.

Trust fs_write: When you're actively working on a project and want Amazon Q to help you create or modify files.

Untrust execute_bash: When working in sensitive environments where you want to review all commands before execution.

Untrust use_aws: When working with production AWS resources to prevent unintended changes.

When Amazon Q uses a tool, it shows you the trust permission being used.



You can also specify trust permissions as part of starting a q chat session.



Summarizing conversations

The /compact command compacts the conversation history and shows the output of the compacted conversation history.

When the length of characters in your conversation history approaches the limit, Amazon Q provides a warning message, indicating that you should /compact your conversation history

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to interact with external tools and services. Amazon Q Developer CLI now supports MCP, allowing you to extend Q's capabilities by connecting it to custom tools and services.

Communication flow between user, Amazon Q Developer CLI, and external services through MCP

Core MCP concepts

Tools
Tools are executable functions that MCP servers expose to clients. They allow Amazon Q to:

Perform actions in external systems

Process data in specialized ways

Interact with APIs and services

Execute commands on your behalf

Tools are defined with a unique name, a description, an input schema (using JSON Schema), and optional annotations about the tool's behavior.

Prompts
Prompts are predefined templates that help guide Amazon Q in specific tasks. They can:

Accept dynamic arguments

Include context from resources

Chain multiple interactions

Guide specific workflows

Surface as UI elements (like slash commands)

Resources
Resources represent data that MCP servers can provide to Amazon Q, such as:

File contents

Database records

API responses

Documentation

Configuration data

MCP configuration in Amazon Q Developer CLI is managed through JSON files. This section covers how to configure MCP servers to extend Q's capabilities.

Configuration files

Amazon Q Developer CLI supports two levels of MCP configuration:

Global Configuration: ~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json - Applies to all workspaces

Workspace Configuration: .amazonq/mcp.json - Specific to the current workspace

If both files exist, their contents are combined. In case of conflicts, the workspace configuration takes precedence.

Configuration format

The MCP configuration file uses a JSON format with the following structure:


{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "command-to-run",
      "args": ["arg1", "arg2"],
      "env": {
        "ENV_VAR1": "value1",
        "ENV_VAR2": "value2"
      }
    }
  }
}
Configuration fields:

mcpServers: Object containing server definitions

server-name: A unique identifier for the MCP server

command: The command to execute to start the MCP server

args: Array of command-line arguments to pass to the command

env: Environment variables to set when running the server

Example configurations

Basic example:


{
  "mcpServers": {
    "markdown-tools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@example/markdown-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
Example with environment variables:


{
  "mcpServers": {
    "api-tools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@example/api-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "API_URL": "https://api.example.com",
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
Configuration reference

The complete schema for MCP configuration files:


{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "string",         // Required: Command to execute
      "args": ["string"],          // Optional: Command-line arguments
      "env": {                     // Optional: Environment variables
        "ENV_VAR": "string"
      }
      ]
    }
  }
}
Environment variable substitution:

${env:VAR_NAME}: Substitutes the value of the environment variable VAR_NAME

${file:/path/to/file}: Substitutes the contents of the specified file

This section covers how to use MCP tools and prompts with Amazon Q Developer CLI.

Understanding MCP tools

MCP tools are executable functions that MCP servers expose to Amazon Q Developer CLI. They enable Q to perform actions, process data, and interact with external systems on your behalf.

Each tool in MCP has:

Name: A unique identifier for the tool

Description: A human-readable description of what the tool does

Input Schema: A JSON Schema defining the parameters the tool accepts

Annotations: Optional hints about the tool's behavior and effects

Discovering available tools

To see what tools are available in your Q CLI session:


/tools
This command displays all available tools, including both built-in tools and those provided by MCP servers.

Tools can have different permission levels that determine how they're used:

Auto-approved: These tools can be used without explicit permission for each invocation

Requires approval: These tools need your explicit permission each time they're used

Dangerous: These tools are marked as potentially risky and require careful consideration before approval

Using tools

You can use MCP tools in two ways:

Natural Language Requests: Simply describe what you want to do, and Q will determine which tool to use.

Direct Tool Invocation: You can also explicitly request Q to use a specific tool.

Working with prompts

MCP servers can provide predefined prompts that help guide Q in specific tasks:

List available prompts: /prompts

Use a prompt: @<server name> <prompt name> [--args=value]

Example of using a prompt with arguments:


@aws-docs explain-service --service=lambda
This would invoke the "explain-service" prompt from the "aws-docs" MCP server, passing "lambda" as the service argument.

When using MCP servers with Amazon Q Developer CLI, it's important to understand the security implications and best practices.

Security model

The MCP security model in Amazon Q Developer CLI is designed with these principles:

Explicit Permission: Tools require explicit user permission before execution

Local Execution: MCP servers run locally on your machine

Isolation: Each MCP server runs as a separate process

Transparency: Users can see what tools are available and what they do

Security considerations

Key security considerations when using MCP:

Only install servers from trusted sources

Review tool descriptions and annotations before approving

Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

Keep MCP servers and the Q CLI updated

Monitor MCP logs for unexpected activity

Using the editor command in the CLI
 PDF
 RSS
Focus mode
The Amazon Q Developer CLI provides an /editor command that opens your preferred text editor to compose complex prompts. This is particularly useful for multi-line prompts, code examples, or when you need to carefully structure your questions.

Basic usage

To open your default editor with an empty prompt:

Amazon Q> /editor
To open your editor with initial text:

Amazon Q> /editor Write a Python function that calculates Fibonacci numbers
When you use the /editor command, Amazon Q creates a temporary file with a .md extension, opens your specified editor with this file, and then reads the content and submits it as your prompt when you save and close the editor.

Setting your preferred editor

Amazon Q uses your system's $EDITOR environment variable to determine which editor to open. If not set, it defaults to vi.

Temporary setting (current session only)
To set your editor for the current terminal session only:

$ export EDITOR=nano
Permanent setting
To make your editor preference persistent across sessions, add the export command to your shell configuration file:

# For bash (add to ~/.bashrc)
export EDITOR=nano

# For zsh (add to ~/.zshrc)
export EDITOR=nano

# For fish shell (add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish)
set -x EDITOR nano
After editing your configuration file, either restart your terminal or source the file:

$ source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
Common editor options
Here are some common editor options you can use:

vi or vim - Vi/Vim text editor

nano - Nano text editor (beginner-friendly)

emacs - Emacs text editor

code -w - Visual Studio Code (requires VS Code CLI to be installed)

subl -w - Sublime Text (requires Sublime CLI to be installed)

Note
The -w flag for GUI editors is important as it makes the terminal wait until the file is closed.

How it works

The /editor command follows this workflow:

When you use the /editor command, Amazon Q creates a temporary file with a .md extension

Your specified editor opens with this file

You write your prompt in the editor and save the file

When you close the editor

Amazon Q reads the content and submits it as your prompt

The temporary file is automatically cleaned up

Working with code in the editor

When you write code in the editor, the entire content is sent as your prompt to Amazon Q when you close the editor. The code is not executed locally - it's treated as text input for the AI.

Example: Writing and submitting code
Type /editor to open your editor

Write a Python script in the editor:


def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
        
# This function seems inefficient
# How can I improve it?
Save and close the editor

Amazon Q will receive this entire text as your prompt and respond with suggestions for improving the code

This approach is useful for:

Getting code reviews

Asking for optimizations

Explaining complex code structures

Providing context for debugging help

Combining with other commands

The /editor command becomes even more powerful when combined with other Amazon Q CLI commands. Here are some practical combinations to enhance your workflow.

Using /editor with /compact
The /compact command makes Amazon Q responses more concise. This combination is excellent for efficient code reviews:

Amazon Q> /editor
# Write in the editor:
Please review this Python function that calculates prime numbers:

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

# Save and close

Amazon Q> /compact
# This makes Amazon Q provide a concise code review
Using /editor with /context
The /context command adds files to the conversation context. This combination is useful for discussing code that references other files:

Amazon Q> /context path/to/config.json
Amazon Q> /editor
# Write in the editor:
Given the config.json file I just shared, please help me write a Python function that:
1. Loads the configuration
2. Validates all required fields are present
3. Returns a validated config object

# Save and close
Using /editor with /clear
The /clear command starts a new conversation. This combination helps when switching topics:

Amazon Q> /clear
Amazon Q> /editor
# Write in the editor:
I want to start a new discussion about AWS Lambda cold starts.
What are the best practices for minimizing cold start times for Python Lambda functions?

# Save and close
Using /editor for multi-step conversations
The /editor command creates a fresh temporary file each time it's used. You can use it multiple times in a conversation to build on previous responses:

# First use of editor for initial complex question
Amazon Q> /editor
# Write in editor:
I need to design a database schema for a library management system.
Requirements:
- Track books, authors, publishers
- Handle member checkouts and returns
- Support reservations and waiting lists
- Generate overdue notices

# After getting Amazon Q's response with initial schema design

# Second use of editor for follow-up with specific implementation details
Amazon Q> /editor
# Write in editor:
Based on your proposed schema, I have some follow-up questions:
1. How would you modify the Member table to support different membership tiers?
2. What indexes would you recommend for optimizing checkout queries?
3. Can you show me SQL to create the Books and Authors tables with proper relationships?
The benefit of this approach is that you can carefully craft complex follow-up questions that reference the previous conversation, without having to type everything in the command line. Each editor session gives you the space and formatting control to compose detailed questions that build on Amazon Q's previous responses.

Using /editor with /profile
Switch to a different context profile before using the editor for specialized questions:

Amazon Q> /profile set aws-developer
Amazon Q> /editor
# Write detailed AWS-specific questions that benefit from the AWS developer profile context
Using /editor with /help
If you're unsure about command options, you can use /help before /editor:

Amazon Q> /help editor
# Review the help information
Amazon Q> /editor
# Use the editor with better understanding of available options
Best practices for command combinations

Use /context before /editor when you need to reference specific files

Use /editor before /compact when you want concise responses to complex questions

Use /clear before /editor when starting a completely new topic

Use multiple /editor sessions for complex, multi-part conversations where you need to carefully craft follow-up questions

Consider your current profile before using /editor to ensure you're in the right context

Tips for effective use

Use the editor for complex prompts that benefit from careful structuring

Include code examples with proper indentation

Organize multi-part questions with clear sections

Use Markdown formatting for better structure

If you save an empty file, no prompt will be submitted

Troubleshooting

Editor not opening: Verify your $EDITOR environment variable is set correctly

"No such file or directory" error: Ensure the editor command is installed and in your PATH

Terminal hanging: For GUI editors, make sure to use the wait flag (e.g., -w)

Content not being submitted: Check that you saved the file before closing the editor

Understanding profiles and context

Profiles allow you to switch between sets of contexts that give you unique ways for Amazon Q Developer CLI to interact with you and your systems. Context files contain information like development rules, project details, or coding standards that Amazon Q uses to provide more relevant and tailored responses.

There is always a default profile, which contains a global context and workspace context:

Global context: Files that are applied to all profiles

Workspace context: Files specific to the current profile

When you add new profiles, they will have their own unique workspace context, allowing you to specify patterns of files that make that profile behave and interact in ways unique to your workflow and processes.

For example, you might create:

A "terraform" profile with infrastructure-as-code guidelines

A "python" profile with Python coding standards

A "java" profile with Java best practices

By switching profiles, you can quickly change the context that Amazon Q uses to provide responses without having to manually specify these files in each conversation.

Managing profiles

You can manage profiles using either the /profile command or the /context profile commands.

Using the /profile command
The /profile command allows you to view and switch between different context profiles in the Amazon Q Developer CLI.

When you run the /profile command without arguments, it displays a list of available profiles:


q chat
> /profile
Available profiles:
* default
  dev
  prod
  staging
The asterisk (*) indicates the currently active profile.

To switch to a different profile, specify the profile name:


q chat
> /profile set dev
Switched to profile: dev
Managing context

Context files are markdown files that contain information you want Amazon Q to consider during your conversations. These can include project requirements, coding standards, development rules, or any other information that helps Amazon Q provide more relevant responses.

Adding context
You can add files or directories to your context using the /context add command:


q chat
> /context add README.md
Added 1 path(s) to profile context.
To add a file to the global context (available across all profiles), use the --global flag:


q chat
> /context add --global coding-standards.md
Added 1 path(s) to global context.
You can also add multiple files at once using glob patterns:


q chat
> /context add docs/*.md
Added 3 path(s) to profile context.
Viewing context
To view your current context, use the /context show command:


q chat
> /context show
Global context:
  /home/user/coding-standards.md

Profile context (terraform):
  /home/user/terraform-project/README.md
  /home/user/terraform-project/docs/architecture.md
  /home/user/terraform-project/docs/best-practices.md
Removing context
To remove files from your context, use the /context rm command:


q chat
> /context rm docs/architecture.md
Removed 1 path(s) from profile context.
To remove files from the global context, use the --global flag:


q chat
> /context rm --global coding-standards.md
Removed 1 path(s) from global context.
To clear all files from your context, use the /context clear command:


q chat
> /context clear
Cleared all paths from profile context.
To clear the global context, use the --global flag:


q chat
> /context clear --global
Cleared all paths from global context.
Common use cases

Here are some common use cases for context profiles:

Using project rules
Amazon Q supports project-level rules that can define security guidelines and restrictions. These rules are defined in Markdown files in the .amazonq/rules directory of your project.

For example, you can create rules that specify:

Which directories Amazon Q should avoid accessing

Security requirements for generated code

Coding standards and best practices

Project rules can be added to your context using the /context add command:


q chat
> /context add .amazonq/rules/*.md
Added 3 path(s) to profile context.
You can also add project rules to your global context to apply them across all profiles:


q chat
> /context add --global .amazonq/rules/security-standards.md
Added 1 path(s) to global context.
For more information about creating and using project rules, see Creating project rules for use with Amazon Q Developer chat in the IDE documentation.

Working with multiple projects
If you work on multiple projects with different requirements, you can create a profile for each project:


q chat
> /profile create project-a
Created profile: project-a
> /context add ./project-a/README.md ./project-a/docs/*.md
Added 4 path(s) to profile context.

> /profile create project-b
Created profile: project-b
> /context add ./project-b/README.md ./project-b/docs/*.md
Added 3 path(s) to profile context.
You can then switch between profiles as you move between projects:


q chat
> /profile project-a
Switched to profile: project-a
Different development roles
You can create profiles for different roles you perform:


q chat
> /profile create backend-dev
Created profile: backend-dev
> /context add backend-standards.md api-docs/*.md
Added 4 path(s) to profile context.

> /profile create devops
Created profile: devops
> /context add infrastructure/*.md deployment-guides/*.md
Added 5 path(s) to profile context.
